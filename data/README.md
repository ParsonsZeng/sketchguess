## Stroke sequence dataset
In our approach, we use sketches from [TU-Berlin dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/). Each sketch is represented as a sequence of strokes. In the WordGuess-160 dataset, the stroke sequences are paired with corresponding guesswords. As a preprocessing step, each stroke sequence image is morphologically dilated ('thickened'). The dataset of thickened stroke sequence can be accessed at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1unRU-zqqdfG3oT2a9Sx53AjlVaIqlBBn) as a .tar.gz archive. The archive contains two directories `sketches_png_css_thickened' and `sketches_png_css_thickened-sym'. The files should be accessed from the latter directory (i.e. `sketches_png_css_thickened-sym').
